To find the vaccination available via pincode - Only india ip is allowed
'''
            sender_email = ""          ######## SENDER EMAIL ID ###############
            receiver_email = ""        ######## RECEIVER EMAIL ID ###############
            password = ""                     ######## SENDER EMAIL ID PASSWORD ###############

 Do above changes in the code to receive alerts via email
 
 I would suggest to use crontab for schedule the alert as per time intervals 
 
 This script find if the vaccination is available according to the vaccine availability according to the PINCODE
 
 Note : if you wish not to receive email comment the email related code and run so that you can just view the output in the terminal
